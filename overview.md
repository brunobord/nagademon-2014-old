# When Sysadmins Rolled The Dice

```irc
04:03 < cor3dumped> WTF is going on? can I get some information about this?
```

"When Sysadmins Rolled The Dice" is a role-playing-game, destined to be played
online, using text-based chat tools (IRC) or more elaborated programs, with VoIP
or real-time video chat (Skype, Mumble, Google Hangout).

You may try to play "In Real Life", too ; but to get the best immersion, playing
on IRC is probably the best option.

That's the reason why I'm talking about a "laptop role-playing game" - it's not
properly speaking a tabletop RPG, and it's definitely not a video game.

In this game players will likely play the role of sysadmins or IT workers, or
just people who can enter datacenters.

Hopefully, you probably won't need specific knowledge of the Internet or
Sysadmin skills to play this game.

## What happened?

A **big** thing happened last night. A massive network attack, shutting down
servers and networks. IT infrastructures are falling, one by one.

You are a sysadmin, a network engineer, someone with root access to a major
datacenter system. Your phone bipped during the night, sending a red-code alert
text message. It was impossible to solve the issue from your home. So you hit
the road through the night to get your way to your dear routers.

Or maybe you were already there, in the white room in the building, hands flying
over your keyboard, lit by the LCD screen on your laptop, with racks slowly
humming along to the melody of fans. And then suddenly, there was this network
blast, this general failure of systems, taken down, one by one.

So you're here, trying to figure out what happened. A worm? a DDOS attack?
hardware failure?

As you're trying to put the network back on, you're connecting to your usual
IRC server/channel, and then you're reading alarming messages by your internet
pals. *Something* more frightening is going on. Something like an apocalypse.

And then your network connection crashed.
