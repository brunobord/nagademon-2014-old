> IRC Rule: You can only talk to the Game Master.

You can describe what you want to do by talking to the Game Master until you're
asked to roll dice.

## Rolling dice

Rolling dice means you'll have to roll two six-sided dice, add them with the appropriate
stat to see the result. Usually, there are three possibilities:

* 6 or lower: bad things happen, it's a failure,
* between 7 and 9: it's fine, but there's a cost, something is going wrong,
* over 10: you succeed and what you want to happen is happening.
