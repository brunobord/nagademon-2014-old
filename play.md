# Play to find out

## Rolling dice

Rolling dice means you'll have to roll two six-sided dice, add them with the appropriate
stat to see the result. Usually, there are three possibilities:

* 6 or lower: bad things happen, it's a failure,
* between 7 and 9: it's fine, but there's a cost, something is going wrong,
* over 10: you succeed and what you want to happen is happening.

## Bandwidth and communication channels

At the beginning of the game, every character has a ``Bandwidth`` gauge of 1.

> IRC Rule: You can only talk to the Game Master. This means you can just
> discuss using ``/query`` messaging.

You can describe what you want to do by talking to the Game Master until you're
asked to roll dice.

As you're fighting with your network setup, you may climb up the ``Bandwidth``
scale and gain more access to a wider range of communication channels.

* At 2, the GM can give you *nicknames* that are able to talk with you. You may
  try to ``/query`` them to figure out what happened.
* At 3 and above, the GM will give you the name of the channel where you can
  ``/join`` and talk with your regular Internet pals. If they're online too.

Of course, if your ``Bandwidth`` gauge is going down, you may lose access to the
common channel (and get kicked out) or the rights to talk to other players. The
GM will tell.

### Bandwith Zero

If your ``Bandwidth`` reaches zero, you're in the dark. You are not allowed to
talk to any other player, including the Game Master. The only thing you can
do is to **wait**.

When the GM send you a private message, then you may try to get back online.
This is, by far, one of the most stressful moment in the game. You're deaf,
dumb and blind, and you can't do anything about this until the GM tells you
something.

### VoIP / Video chat rules

If you're playing using a VoIP system, your microphone and camera should be off
below level 5.

At level 5, you can switch your microphone on.

At level 6, if you're playing via a video chat system, you can turn your camera
on.

Obviously, if your ``Bandwidth`` gauge is going down, you'll have to shut these
services down accordingly.
