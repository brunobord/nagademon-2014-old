# NaGaDeMon 2014

This is the repository for the [NaGaDeMon 2014](http://nagademon.com/) entry by
Bruno Bord. The goal is to create a game during the month of November 2014.

My goal is to write a Role-Playing Game, loosely based on the
[Apocalypse World Engine](http://apocalypse-world.com/).

This game is meant to be played using text-based chat, such as IRC, or even more
advanced instant messaging services (Mumble, Teamspeak, Skype, Google Hangout...)

You can browse the [Changelog](Changelog.md) to see the history.
