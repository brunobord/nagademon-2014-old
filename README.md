# NaGaDeMon 2014

This is the repository for the [NaGaDeMon 2014](http://nagademon.com/) entry by
Bruno Bord. The goal is to create a game during the month of November 2014.

My goal is to write a Role-Playing Game, loosely based on the
[Apocalypse World Engine](http://apocalypse-world.com/).

This game is meant to be played using text-based chat, such as IRC, or even more
advanced instant messaging services (Mumble, Teamspeak, Skype, Google Hangout...)

You can browse the [Changelog](Changelog.md) to see the history.

**WARNING**: this is still **Work In Progress**, I'll tell you when it's ready.

## Inspirations

The most obvious source of inspiration will be the short story
["When Sysadmins Ruled The Earth"](http://craphound.com/overclocked/Cory_Doctorow_-_Overclocked_-_When_Sysadmins_Ruled_the_Earth.html),
by Cory Doctorow, originally published in Baenâ€™s Universe, 2006.
